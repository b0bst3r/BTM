b0bst3r's Technological Marvel Minecraft 1.12.1 Mod Pack

This is the repository for BTM modpack written by b0bst3r.

The modpack has applied for ATLauncher status but there is currently a 2 month approval list so temporarily this pack is available on the MultiMC launcher and instructions for installing it are listed below.

Create a new 1.12.1 instance in MultiMC

Run your instance once and then exit Minecraft back to the launcher (this creates all the necessary folders and files).

Download the package here https://www.dropbox.com/s/tssn31t1nvjm0jb/BTM_MMC_Install.zip?dl=1

Unzip the package into the instance folder over writing everything.

For example if you created an instance called BTM you would unpack the zip into MultiMC\instances\BTM where you see the minecraft folder.

Run the package and it should add all the mods.
