## b0bst3r's Technological Marvel Minecraft 1.12.1 Mod Pack

This is the repository for BTM modpack written by b0bst3r, it is in no way associated with Better Than Minecraft by Asie.

The modpack has applied for ATLauncher status but there is currently a 2 month approval waiting list so temporarily this pack is available on the MultiMC launcher and instructions for installing it are listed below.

Create a new 1.12.1 instance in MultiMC

Run your instance once and then exit Minecraft back to the launcher (this creates all the necessary folders and files).

Download the package here https://www.dropbox.com/s/tssn31t1nvjm0jb/BTM_MMC_Install.zip?dl=1

Unzip the package into the instance folder over writing everything.

For example if you created an instance called BTM you would unpack the zip into MultiMC\instances\BTM where you see the minecraft folder.

Run the package and it should add all the mods.

## About the Pack

BTM was created with Tech in mind, but with a difference, the core mods in the pack are Better with Mods and Futurepack.  Futurepack is a rarely used mod but has been around for a while, think Thaumcraft but as a tech mod.

Better with Mods makes everything much much harder, ores smelt to nuggets, dusts smelt to nuggets until you reach mid to end game, so mine hard and reap the rewards.

Don't get despondent if you don't reach end game in a day or 3, the idea of the pack is to stretch out end game without modifying a lot of recipes to make you grind (Better with mods does that for you :))

And before you ask, Draconic ores only spawn in Futurepack dimensions, so to get to draconic you literally have to finish Futurepack.

Good luck
